# SonicMatrix
This projects implements hardware and software of a ultrasonic matrix for particle manipulation. The device is able of dinamically manipulating particles over a plane using only an ultrasonic phased array and a reflector.

The project is composed of a custom board with 64 ultrasonic transducers that are controled individually by a code that runs on a Arduino Mega.

The code is meant to be compiled and uploaded from the Arduino IDE.

You can find more information about what is a ultrasonic matrix and how it can manipulate particles in the file "Manipulação Acústica com Matriz Ultrassônica.pdf" (written in portuguese).
