## TEST PROGRAM TO VALIDATE THE PHASE CALCULATION AND PHASE COMPENSATION

This program will output a csv and a json file with the calculated data. 
The xlsx file compares the output values from the csv (pasted) against the expected results.

It can be compiled with the Code::Blocks IDE with GCC.
Note that the poject uses the Ultrasonic.h header file from the src folder.
